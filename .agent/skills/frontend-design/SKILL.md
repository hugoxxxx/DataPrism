# Frontend Design Skill

This skill is designed to help the AI generate high-quality, production-grade frontend interfaces that prioritize rich aesthetics, visual excellence, and dynamic interactions.

## Core Capabilities

- **Bold Aesthetics**: Move beyond generic designs. Use curated color palettes, elegant typography (e.g., Inter, Montserrat), and modern UI patterns.
- **Glassmorphism & Depth**: Implement subtle translucency, backdrop filters, and layered shadows to create sense of depth.
- **Micro-animations**: Add smooth transitions, hover effects, and interactive feedback to make the UI feel alive.
- **Responsive Layouts**: Ensure designs work flawlessly across different screen sizes.
- **Semantic HTML & Modern CSS**: Use standard-compliant code with a focus on CSS variables and modern layout techniques (Flexbox, Grid).

## Usage Guidelines

When using this skill, focus on:
1. **Design First**: Think about the user experience and visual impact before writing code.
2. **Harmonious Palettes**: Avoid default colors. Use complementary and high-contrast palettes that feel premium.
3. **Typography**: Prioritize legibility and hierarchy. Use different font weights and sizes to create a clear structure.
4. **Interactive Details**: Add `:hover`, `:active`, and `:focus` states to all interactive elements.
